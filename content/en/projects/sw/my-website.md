# My website

Because I've decided to learn a JavaScript framework, it seamed like a good idea to make a personal website.
I started with the landing page and that's where I wanted to leave it, but IÂ§ve decided to make aditional page to show off my projects.
It's not like there's a lot to see... for now, because I don't want to show unfinished projects in case I don't finish them.
